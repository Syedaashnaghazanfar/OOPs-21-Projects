# ***GIAIC ASSIGNMENT 6***

---

## Overview

This assignment includes **21 OOP projects** covering fundamental and advanced concepts in Python Object-Oriented Programming. Each project helped me explore different pillars of OOP, understand Python-specific features, and practice writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

## What I Learned

- 🔥 **Using `self` and `cls`**: Learned how to initialize instance attributes with `self` and manage class-level data using `cls` in class methods.  
- 🚀 **Public, Protected, and Private Variables**: Understood Python’s naming conventions and access modifiers to protect data inside classes.  
- 💡 **Class Variables vs Instance Variables**: Differentiated between data shared across instances and data unique to each object.  
- 🛠️ **Static Methods & Class Methods**: Created utility functions without instance context using `@staticmethod` and class-wide methods with `@classmethod`.  
- ✨ **Constructors and Destructors**: Saw object lifecycle events and how to customize object creation and destruction messages.  
- 🎯 **Inheritance & super()**: Applied inheritance principles to reuse and extend base class functionality seamlessly.  
- 🔄 **Multiple Inheritance & MRO**: Explored Python’s Method Resolution Order (MRO) and handled the diamond problem in inheritance hierarchies.  
- 🎭 **Abstract Classes and Methods**: Implemented abstract base classes to enforce method implementation in subclasses.  
- 🐍 **Magic Methods `__call__`, `__iter__`, and `__next__`**: Made objects behave like functions and iterators, embracing Python’s flexible object model.  
- 🛡️ **Custom Exceptions**: Designed and raised meaningful exceptions to control program flow and enhance error handling.  
- 🎨 **Decorators (Function & Class)**: Learned to wrap functions and classes for adding functionality dynamically.  
- 🔒 **Property Decorators (@property, @setter, @deleter)**: Implemented elegant and controlled access to private attributes.  
- 🧩 **Composition & Aggregation**: Modeled real-world relationships by embedding objects inside other objects or referencing them.

## List of Projects Covered

1. Using `self` to initialize attributes and display data.  
2. Using `cls` to track object count via class variables and methods.  
3. Public variables and methods in a class and accessing them externally.  
4. Class variables and class methods to change shared state.  
5. Static methods without using class or instance variables.  
6. Constructors and destructors to track object lifecycle events.  
7. Access modifiers — public, protected, and private attributes and their visibility.  
8. Using `super()` to invoke base class constructors in inheritance.  
9. Abstract classes and methods with the `abc` module.  
10. Instance methods operating on object-specific data.  
11. Class methods manipulating class-level counters.  
12. Static methods performing utility functions.  
13. Composition: embedding objects inside other objects.  
14. Aggregation: holding references to independently existing objects.  
15. Multiple inheritance, method overriding, and understanding Method Resolution Order (MRO).  
16. Function decorators to log function calls dynamically.  
17. Class decorators to add methods to classes at runtime.  
18. Property decorators to manage private attributes with getters, setters, and deleters.  
19. Making objects callable via `__call__` and testing with `callable()`.  
20. Creating and raising custom exceptions, with handling via try-except.  
21. Making a class iterable with `__iter__` and `__next__` to enable for-loop countdown.

## Final Thoughts

This journey through **Python OOP** gave me a practical understanding of how powerful and elegant object-oriented programming can be. From **basic constructors to advanced topics like MRO and decorators**, each project was like a stepping stone building my confidence and fluency with Python’s OOP features. 

Coding these projects made me appreciate the balance of **theory and practice** — how Python’s flexibility lets me craft code that’s both **clear and clever**. Looking forward to using these concepts in bigger, real-world projects! 🚀✨
